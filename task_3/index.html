<h2>4 other psuedo classes and 4 other pseudo elemetns that I never used before</h2>
<h3>psuedo classes</h3>
<p id="customPar1">
  1.:nth-of-type(n): This pseudo-class allows you to select elements based on their position within their parent.<br> You can specify a numerical value n to select every nth element of a certain type. For example, p:nth-of-type(odd) selects all odd-numbered paragraphs</p>

  <p id="customPar1">
    2.:not(selector):

    The :not() pseudo-class allows you to select elements that do not match a specific selector. For example, <br>a:not(.external) selects all anchor links that do not have the class "external."</p>
 
    <p id="customPar1">
   3.:focus-within:

   This pseudo-class selects an element when any of its descendants receive focus. It's commonly used in forms and<br> interactive elements to style parent elements when child elements have focus.</p>
  
   <p id="customPar1">
    4. :empty:

    The :empty pseudo-class selects elements that have no children or contain only whitespace. It's useful for styling<br> or targeting elements based on their content.</p>

    <h3>psuedo elements</h3>

    <p id="customPar1">
      1.::before:

      The ::before pseudo-element is used to insert content before the content of an element. It's often employed to add<br> decorative elements or labels before an element's content.</p>
      <p id="customPar1">
        2.::after:

        Similar to ::before, ::after inserts content after the content of an element. It's frequently used to add decorative <br>elements or generate content dynamically.</p>
     
        <p id="customPar1">
       3.::first-line:

       The ::first-line pseudo-element selects the first line of a block-level element. You can apply styles specifically to the <br>first line of text within a paragraph or heading, for example..</p>
      
       <p id="customPar1">
        4. ::first-letter:

        The ::first-letter pseudo-element selects the first letter or character of a block-level element. It's often used to apply <br>styles to initial characters for drop caps or other decorative effects..</p>
    

        <h3>What does box-sizing and border do</h3>
        <h3>box-sizing:border box</h3>

        <p id="customPar1">
          The CSS property box-sizing with a value of border-box changes how an element calculates its size, particularly its width and height.<br>

          By default, when box-sizing is set to content-box (which is the default value), an element's size is calculated based on its content area, excluding padding and borders.<br> In other words, the width and height are determined by the content itself.
          
          When you set box-sizing: border-box, you change this behavior<br>. With border-box, an element's size calculation includes its content, padding, and borders. In simple terms, it treats the element's specified width and height as inclusive of the padding and borders.</p>
  
          <h3>2 ways of using color</h3>
  <h3>1.Background color</h3>
  <p id="customPar1">
    You can set the background color of elements, such as the background of a webpage, divs, sections, or buttons.<br>
Background color can create visual separation, highlight important content, and contribute to the overall design and aesthetics of a website.<br>
body {
  background-color: #f0f0f0; /* Set the background color of the entire webpage */
}
</p>
<h3>2.Text- color</h3>
  <p   id="customPar1">
    You can set the color of text to improve readability and create visual hierarchy. Different text colors can be used for headings,<br> body text, links, and more.
    Choosing appropriate text colors that contrast well with the background helps users read content comfortably.<br> These are just a couple of ways color is used in web design. It's also important for branding, visual consistency, and conveying emotions and messages through design.<br>
    
    h1 {
      color: #333; /* Set the text color of heading elements */
    }
    a {
      color: #0077cc; /* Set the text color of links */
    }
